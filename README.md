- Configure a systemd automount for a second disk or loopback device

**Project 3:**
- Set up a Linux VM with multiple network interfaces.
- Use `ip`, `netstat`, `ss`, `tcpdump` to debug network traffic.
- Create firewall rules with `iptables` or `nftables` to control access


**Project 4:**
- Deploy two backend web servers (e.g., simple Python Flask apps).
- Set up HAProxy on a front-end server for round-robin load balancing.
- Add HTTPS termination (self-signed TLS certificate).
